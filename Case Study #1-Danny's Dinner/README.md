### Introduction
Danny is a big fan of Japanese cuisine, and at the start of 2021, he took a bold step by opening a small, charming restaurant specializing in his three favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen.

Now, Dannyâ€™s Diner needs your help to keep the business thriving. The restaurant has collected some basic data from its first months of operation but lacks the expertise to analyze and utilize this information effectively for better decision-making.
### Problem Statement
Danny wants to analyze his customer data to understand their visiting habits, spending patterns, and favorite menu items. These insights will help him improve customer experience and decide whether to expand the loyalty program.

He also needs simple, pre-generated datasets for his team to inspect without using SQL. Due to privacy concerns, Danny has provided a sample of customer data, which includes three key datasets:

- sales
- menu
- members
